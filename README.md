## File description
### Code
- **variogram_paper_obs_icon.py**: Main script for reading and analyzing FESSTVaL 2021 observations and ICON-LES data
- **variogram_paper_routines.py**: Routines for data reading and plotting used by variogram_paper_obs_icon.py
- **fesstval_routines.py**: Routines for reading, processing, and analyzing FESSTVaL observation data used by variogram_paper_obs_icon.py, variogram_paper_routines.py, and read_icon_data.ipynb
- **emprical_variogram.py**: Routines for calculation of empirical variograms
- **read_icon_data.ipynb**: Main script for processing ICON-LES data
- **icon_routines.py**: Routines for reading and processing ICON-LES data used by read_icon_data.ipynb
- **cp_spatial_analysis.py**: Routines needed for spatial interpolation of ICON data used by read_icon_data.ipynb
- **variogram_figures_2_3.m**: Matlab script for reading variogram netcdf files from observations and array of simulations, and creating Figures 2 and 3 of the manuscript
- **matlab_functions/**: sub-folder containing Matlab functions and colormap arrays used by variogram_figures_2_3.m script

### RAMS_Code
- **fig1_data_v04.ipynb**: Creates NetCDF file containing data plotted in figure 1.
- **get_network_Ts.py**: Reads in RAMS output, linerally interpolates temperature data to the FESSTVaL network, and saves this data as H5 files as an intermediate step. All of the other scripts in RAMS_code then use these H5 files.
- **Tref_dTmean_dTmin_stds.ipynb**: Calculates the reference temperature, mean and minimum temperatures, and mean and minimum standard devations. All information included in table 1. 
- **variogram_data_v02.ipynb**: Creates NetCDF file containing data plotted in figure 3.
